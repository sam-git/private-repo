============

contains some gansta ipsum and a simple speech recognition app.

the speech recognition app uses a webkit api currenly only supported in chrome.
it also requires that page originate from a web server rather than file://

This is easy enough using the python simple http server invoked using

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
